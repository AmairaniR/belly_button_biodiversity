# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview

This project creates a dashboard using html, javascript, plotly, and D3.js to visualise thre bacterial data for each volunteer for a company that wants to manufacture synthetic beef. The dashboard is filtered by each volunteer. For each volunteer, there is a panel for their demographic information, a horizontal bar chart that displays the top 10 bacterial species for that volunteer, a guage chart that guages the washing frquency for each volunteer, and finally a bubble chart that displays which bacteria culture are found in a volunteer and the frequency at which it is found in that volunteer.
